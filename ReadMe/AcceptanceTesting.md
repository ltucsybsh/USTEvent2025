# âœ… Acceptance Testing Error Criteria Checklist

Acceptance testing is the final phase of validation before deployment, evaluating the system against the end-user and stakeholder requirements. Its primary aim is to determine whether the software is acceptable for release and provides the expected business value.

---

## 1. User Story / Use Case Validation
- [ ] Test the system using realistic, user-centered scenarios.
- [ ] Focus on high-priority and critical business use cases.
- [ ] Confirm that all user stories have been implemented as defined.
- [ ] Validate that acceptance criteria are fully satisfied.
- [ ] Ensure the system supports intended business processes and workflows.
- [ ] Verify integration with other tools/systems in the user environment.

---

## 2. End-User Experience
- [ ] Perform usability testing with real or representative users.
- [ ] Identify any UI/UX friction points that could reduce adoption.
- [ ] Collect user feedback during pilot sessions or walkthroughs.
- [ ] Test accessibility compliance (e.g., WCAG 2.1 standards).
- [ ] Confirm intuitive navigation, error prompts, and feature discoverability.

---

## 3. Data Integrity and Accuracy
- [ ] Validate correct data entry, processing, and storage for key user actions.
- [ ] Ensure enforcement of all user-facing validation rules (e.g., required fields, data formats).
- [ ] Test data migration (if applicable) for completeness and correctness.
- [ ] Confirm data integrity and consistency across the system.
- [ ] Verify the accuracy of reports and dashboard information from the end-user view.

---

## 4. System Stability and Reliability
- [ ] Test how the system behaves when errors occur (e.g., invalid input, unavailable services).
- [ ] Check that user-facing error messages are helpful and not technical.
- [ ] Evaluate system performance under realistic loads.
- [ ] Confirm the system can recover from unexpected shutdowns or network outages.
- [ ] Ensure user sessions and data are preserved during recovery.

---

## 5. Compliance and Regulatory Requirements
- [ ] Verify compliance with applicable laws and regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS).
- [ ] Confirm that security features (e.g., encryption, access controls) meet user expectations.
- [ ] Test audit logging and user consent features from a usability standpoint.
- [ ] Validate proper role-based access for different types of users.

---

## 6. Installation and Configuration
- [ ] Test the installation process from a non-technical userâ€™s perspective (if applicable).
- [ ] Confirm that setup instructions are clear, accurate, and complete.
- [ ] Validate system behavior under different configuration scenarios.
- [ ] Ensure configuration settings are easy to access and use.

## ðŸ”„ Key Differences from System Testing
- [ ] **User-Centric Focus**: Acceptance testing prioritizes stakeholder-defined outcomes over technical completeness.
- [ ] **Production-Like Environment**: Often conducted in staging or pre-production systems.
- [ ] **Business Value Validation**: Confirms the software supports real workflows and adds business value.
- [ ] **Stakeholder-Driven**: Involves users, business analysts, product owners, and sometimes customers.
- [ ] **Go/No-Go Decision**: Determines if the product is ready for live release.
