### 🔁 Evolution of NLP: From Rules to LLMs

#### 1. **Rule-Based NLP (1950s–1980s)**
- **What it is**: Language processing based on hard-coded rules and grammars (e.g., if a sentence has "not", mark it as negative sentiment).
- **Example tools**: ELIZA (1966), based on pattern-matching.
- **Limitation**: Brittle, poor generalization, hard to scale.

- [ELIZA Demo (MIT)](http://psych.fullerton.edu/mbirnbaum/psych101/Eliza.htm) – An interactive version of the early chatbot using rule-based logic.

#### 2. **Statistical NLP (1980s–2000s)**
- **What it is**: Models that learn probabilities from data. Example: Using word co-occurrence to predict the next word.
- **Key concepts**: N-grams, HMMs (Hidden Markov Models), POS tagging with probabilities.
- **Limitation**: Can’t handle long-range dependencies well.

🧩 *Try this*:  
- [N-Gram Explorer](https://books.google.com/ngrams) – See how often word sequences appear over time in books.  
- [POS Tagging Demo (Stanford)](https://corenlp.run/) – Enter text and get POS tags, dependencies, etc.

#### 3. **Classical Machine Learning for NLP (2000s–2015)**
- **What it is**: Use algorithms like Naive Bayes, SVMs, logistic regression with manually engineered features (like TF-IDF, POS tags).
- **Example use cases**: Spam detection, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition.

🧩 *Try this*:  
- [Scikit-learn Text Classification Tutorial](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/text_analytics/working_with_text_data.html) – Shows how to classify documents using Naive Bayes + TF-IDF.  
- [Weka Tool](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) – A GUI-based ML platform where you can play with classic ML models.

#### 4. **Deep Learning for NLP (2015–2017)**
- **What it is**: Shift to using neural networks to learn features automatically. RNNs and LSTMs became popular here.
- **Advantage**: Better at capturing sequence and context.
- **Limitation**: Training is slow, and long-term dependencies still tricky.

🧩 *Try this*:  
- [RNN Visualizer](https://distill.pub/2019/memorization-in-rnns/) – Watch how RNNs remember parts of input over time.

#### 5. **Transformers & LLMs (2017–Now)**
- **Key moment**: [“Attention is All You Need” (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)
- **What it is**: Models like BERT, GPT, and T5 that rely on self-attention and process all tokens at once (not sequentially).
- **Why it works**: Scales well with data and compute. Captures context globally.
