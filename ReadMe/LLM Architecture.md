# Understanding Large Language Model Architectures (GPT, BERT, LLaMA, Gemini)

## Beginner-Friendly Overviews

- **“How GPT-3 Works – Easily Explained with Animations” (Jay Alammar, Video & Blog)** – A gentle, visual introduction to how GPT-style models generate text. This resource demystifies the training process and transformer architecture behind GPT-3 with simple animations ([How GPT3 Works - Visualizations and Animations – Jay Alammar – Visualizing machine learning one concept at a time.](https://jalammar.github.io/how-gpt3-works-visualizations-animations/#:~:text=Please%20note%3A%20This%20is%20a,pdf)). It explains concepts like the model’s **autoregressive** nature (predicting the next word from prior context) ([How GPT3 Works - Visualizations and Animations – Jay Alammar – Visualizing machine learning one concept at a time.](https://jalammar.github.io/how-gpt3-works-visualizations-animations/#:~:text=Please%20note%3A%20This%20is%20a,pdf)) and highlights the scale of GPT-3 (175 billion parameters) in an accessible way. Great as a first look at what large language models are and how they function under the hood.

- **“Foundation Models, Transformers, BERT and GPT” (Niklas Heidloff, Blog)** – A high-level overview comparing **BERT vs. GPT** for newcomers. It introduces the Transformer’s encoder-decoder design and then explains that **BERT uses only the encoder** (bidirectional attention for understanding) while **GPT uses only the decoder** (unidirectional attention for generation) ([Foundation Models, Transformers, BERT and GPT | Niklas Heidloff](https://heidloff.net/article/foundation-models-transformers-bert-and-gpt/#:~:text=,ambiguous%20words%20and%20coreferences)) ([Foundation Models, Transformers, BERT and GPT | Niklas Heidloff](https://heidloff.net/article/foundation-models-transformers-bert-and-gpt/#:~:text=The%20original%20transformer%20architecture%20defines,More%20on%20this%20later)). The article uses simple language and examples (like focusing on words in a sentence to answer *who/what/when* questions) to illustrate how *attention* works ([Foundation Models, Transformers, BERT and GPT | Niklas Heidloff](https://heidloff.net/article/foundation-models-transformers-bert-and-gpt/#:~:text=Attention)) ([Foundation Models, Transformers, BERT and GPT | Niklas Heidloff](https://heidloff.net/article/foundation-models-transformers-bert-and-gpt/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CSarah%20went%20to%20a%20restaurant,%E2%80%9D)). This is an excellent starting point to grasp why GPT excels at text generation and BERT at text understanding.

- **“How do Transformers work?” (Hugging Face Course Chapter)** – An interactive, beginner-friendly tutorial that breaks down the general **Transformer architecture** into encoder and decoder components. It explains in simple terms what each part does: encoders build representations of the input, decoders generate outputs ([How do Transformers work? - Hugging Face NLP Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/en/chapter1/4#:~:text=The%20model%20is%20primarily%20composed,of%20two%20blocks)). The guide shows how modern models derive from this design: **encoder-only models** (like BERT) handle understanding tasks, **decoder-only models** (like GPT) handle generation, and **encoder-decoder models** (like T5) handle translation or summarization ([How do Transformers work? - Hugging Face NLP Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/en/chapter1/4#:~:text=Each%20of%20these%20parts%20can,independently%2C%20depending%20on%20the%20task)). Diagrams in this chapter visually illustrate how tokens flow through the layers, making it easy to follow along.

 ([The Illustrated Transformer – Jay Alammar – Visualizing machine learning one concept at a time.](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/)) *Figure: Simplified Transformer architecture with two encoder layers (green) and two decoder layers (pink). Models like BERT use only the encoder stack, while GPT-type models use only the decoder stack ([The Illustrated Transformer – Jay Alammar – Visualizing machine learning one concept at a time.](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/#:~:text=This%20goes%20for%20the%20sub,would%20look%20something%20like%20this)).* 

- **“The Illustrated Transformer” (Jay Alammar, Blog)** – A step-by-step visual walk-through of the original Transformer model that underpins GPT, BERT, and others. It introduces key concepts one by one – from self-attention to multi-head attention and positional encoding – with intuitive diagrams. By visualizing how **words attend to each other** in a sentence and how encoders & decoders stack together ([The Illustrated Transformer – Jay Alammar – Visualizing machine learning one concept at a time.](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/#:~:text=The%20encoding%20component%20is%20a,decoders%20of%20the%20same%20number)) ([The Illustrated Transformer – Jay Alammar – Visualizing machine learning one concept at a time.](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/#:~:text=The%20encoder%E2%80%99s%20inputs%20first%20flow,attention%20later%20in%20the%20post)), this post builds a mental model of the full architecture. It’s an excellent bridge from basic intuition to the actual mechanics of Transformer networks.

- **“The Illustrated BERT, ELMo, and co. (How NLP Cracked Transfer Learning)” (Jay Alammar, Blog)** – A richly illustrated guide to **BERT’s architecture and training**. It explains BERT’s two-phase training (pre-training on unlabeled text with masked words, then fine-tuning on specific tasks) with clear visuals. For example, an infographic shows BERT being pre-trained on Wikipedia text by predicting masked words, and then fine-tuned to a classification task ([The Illustrated BERT, ELMo, and co. (How NLP Cracked Transfer Learning) – Jay Alammar – Visualizing machine learning one concept at a time.](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/#:~:text=Image%20The%20two%20steps%20of,Source%20for%20book%20icon)). This blog also surveys earlier milestones like word embeddings and ELMo, helping readers understand how BERT built on those ideas to achieve bidirectional language understanding.

 ([The Illustrated BERT, ELMo, and co. (How NLP Cracked Transfer Learning) – Jay Alammar – Visualizing machine learning one concept at a time.](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/)) *Figure: BERT’s two-step training (left: unsupervised pre-training on a large text corpus, right: supervised fine-tuning on a specific task) ([The Illustrated BERT, ELMo, and co. (How NLP Cracked Transfer Learning) – Jay Alammar – Visualizing machine learning one concept at a time.](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/#:~:text=Image%20The%20two%20steps%20of,Source%20for%20book%20icon)).* 

- **“The Illustrated GPT-2” (Jay Alammar, Blog)** – A visual exploration of the GPT-2 model, which is a direct predecessor of GPT-3. This article dives into the **transformer decoder stack** that GPT models use, explaining how GPT-2 processes text step-by-step. It uses diagrams to show the flow of tokens through multiple decoder layers and how the model learns to predict the next word ([How GPT3 Works - Visualizations and Animations – Jay Alammar – Visualizing machine learning one concept at a time.](https://jalammar.github.io/how-gpt3-works-visualizations-animations/#:~:text=Please%20note%3A%20This%20is%20a,pdf)). By examining GPT-2’s attention patterns and architecture, readers can appreciate how later models like GPT-3 and GPT-4 scale up the same principles. (For an even more interactive exploration, the blog post includes an open-source code example to visualize GPT-2’s attention heads.)

- **“Language Models: From GPT to LLaMA” (Saurabh Harak, Medium)** – A comprehensive article that **chronologically narrates the evolution** of LLMs from early transformers to GPT-4 and Meta’s LLaMA. It starts with why Transformers were revolutionary (breaking the limitations of RNNs with parallel processing and long-range attention) ([Language Models: From GPT to LLaMA | by Saurabh Harak | Medium](https://saurabhharak.medium.com/language-models-from-gpt-to-llama-3edcd9b856b6#:~:text=Transformers%20were%20introduced%20in%20a,one%20step%20at%20a%20time)) ([Language Models: From GPT to LLaMA | by Saurabh Harak | Medium](https://saurabhharak.medium.com/language-models-from-gpt-to-llama-3edcd9b856b6#:~:text=Another%20critical%20innovation%20was%20parallel,to%20train%20and%20more%20scalable)), then explains GPT’s autoregressive approach versus BERT’s bidirectional approach. Importantly, it highlights what LLaMA brought to the table: achieving GPT-3-level performance with far fewer parameters by training efficiently ([Language Models: From GPT to LLaMA | by Saurabh Harak | Medium](https://saurabhharak.medium.com/language-models-from-gpt-to-llama-3edcd9b856b6#:~:text=match%20at%20L266%20LLaMA%20is,makes%20LLaMA%20more%20accessible%20to)) ([Language Models: From GPT to LLaMA | by Saurabh Harak | Medium](https://saurabhharak.medium.com/language-models-from-gpt-to-llama-3edcd9b856b6#:~:text=LLaMA%20is%20designed%20to%20match,makes%20LLaMA%20more%20accessible%20to)). The piece compares each model’s focus — GPT for text generation, BERT for understanding, **LLaMA for efficiency and open accessibility** ([Language Models: From GPT to LLaMA | by Saurabh Harak | Medium](https://saurabhharak.medium.com/language-models-from-gpt-to-llama-3edcd9b856b6#:~:text=,such%20as%20sentiment%20analysis%2C%20question)) ([Language Models: From GPT to LLaMA | by Saurabh Harak | Medium](https://saurabhharak.medium.com/language-models-from-gpt-to-llama-3edcd9b856b6#:~:text=stronger%20in%20tasks%20that%20involve,experimentation%2C%20innovation%2C%20and%20responsible%20development)) — giving a well-rounded understanding of their differences.

- **“BERT Explained – Training, Inference, & Comparison with GPT/LLaMA” (Umar Jamil, YouTube)** – A 30-minute educational video (with slides and diagrams) that breaks down BERT’s inner workings and then **compares BERT with GPT and LLaMA**. The presenter walks through how BERT is pre-trained (masked language modeling and next sentence prediction), what the special [CLS] token does, and how fine-tuning works. He then contrasts this with GPT’s generative setup (noting GPT’s autoregressive next-word prediction and lack of bidirectional context) and discusses LLaMA’s efficiency (smaller model, specialized training). This video is great for seeing the concepts in action, with the visuals reinforcing why each architecture excels at different tasks.

- **Google’s *“Introducing Gemini”* (Official Blog & Fact Sheet)** – Google’s announcement of **Gemini** provides an easy-to-read overview of this new model family. It explains that Gemini is a multimodal LLM built on transformer decoder architecture (the same core design as GPT) ([Google Gemini and the future of large language models](https://www.understandingai.org/p/google-gemini-and-the-future-of-large#:~:text=published%20a%2062,not%20much%20more%20than%20that)). What sets Gemini apart is its ability to natively handle text *and* other modalities like images or audio. The blog mentions that Gemini can even **generate images from text prompts** using learned visual tokens ([Google Gemini and the future of large language models](https://www.understandingai.org/p/google-gemini-and-the-future-of-large#:~:text=Multimodality%E2%80%94the%20ability%20to%20deal%20with,the%20Gemini%20white%20paper%20states)). It also notes Gemini comes in different sizes (Nano, Pro, Ultra) to serve everything from mobile devices to powerful servers. While not very technical, this resource gives a broad understanding of Gemini’s capabilities and goals (state-of-the-art performance, efficiency, multimodality) in comparison to earlier models.

- **“What is Google Gemini (Formerly Bard)?” (TechTarget article)** – A more detailed explainer on Gemini that covers its features and improvements over previous models. It describes the **Gemini architecture’s ability to ingest multiple data types** (text, images, audio, video) in a single sequence ([What is the Google Gemini AI Model (Formerly Bard)? | Definition from TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/Google-Gemini#:~:text=diagrams%20to%20solve%20complex%20problems,video%20frames%20as%20interleaved%20sequences)). The article highlights Google DeepMind’s use of *efficient attention mechanisms* in Gemini to handle very long prompts across modalities ([What is the Google Gemini AI Model (Formerly Bard)? | Definition from TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/Google-Gemini#:~:text=architecture,long%20contexts%2C%20spanning%20different%20modalities)). It also situates Gemini relative to others: for example, noting it is a **chatbot model like OpenAI’s GPT-4**, and built to surpass Google’s own PaLM 2. This is a useful resource to understand Gemini’s design philosophy (versatility and efficiency) and how it aims to compete with or leapfrog models like GPT.

- **BertViz (Interactive Open-Source Tool)** – *BertViz* is an excellent tool for those who learn best by interacting with the model itself. It allows you to **visualize the attention patterns** inside transformer models like BERT, GPT-2, and others ([BertViz: Visualize Attention in NLP Models (BERT, GPT2, BART, etc.)](https://github.com/jessevig/bertviz#:~:text=etc,a%20Jupyter%20or%20Colab)). With BertViz, you can enter your own sentence and see which words the model’s attention heads focus on at each layer — a peek into the “black box” of the network. This hands-on exploration makes abstract concepts concrete, showing, for instance, how in BERT’s encoder certain heads attend to symmetrical positions (like quotation marks pairing) or how GPT’s decoder attends heavily to recent tokens for next-word prediction. By experimenting with BertViz, learners can build an intuition for *how* and *why* these architectures work the way they do.

## Technical Deep Dives and Original Papers

- **“Attention Is All You Need” (Vaswani et al., 2017)** – The seminal research paper that introduced the Transformer architecture. This paper is a must-read for a deep technical understanding of how LLMs work at the core. It defines the full encoder-decoder architecture with multi-head self-attention and feed-forward layers, and includes diagrams of the model architecture and attention mechanism. Reading this paper gives insight into the design decisions that powers GPT, BERT, LLaMA, and more. *(The paper is math-heavy, but sections of it, alongside its figures, provide the blueprint for all modern LLM architectures.)*

- **BERT Original Paper (Devlin et al., 2018)** – The academic paper *“BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding”* detailing BERT’s architecture and training approach. It explains how BERT uses an **encoder-only transformer** and introduces the novel **masked language modeling** task to enable bidirectional training ([The Transformer model family](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_summary#:~:text=BERT%20is%20an%20encoder,help%20it%20learn%20a%20deeper)). The paper also outlines the next-sentence prediction objective and shows BERT’s architecture diagram (a stack of transformer encoder layers with input embeddings). This is a foundational read to understand how BERT achieved its superior understanding of context by looking at words from both left and right.

- **GPT-3 Paper (Brown et al., 2020)** – *“Language Models are Few-Shot Learners”* is the influential paper that unveiled GPT-3. It describes the **decoder-only transformer architecture** scaling up to 175 billion parameters, and how such scale leads to emergent capabilities like few-shot learning. The paper doesn’t reveal model weights but provides architectural specs and plenty of evaluation results. Notably, it shows examples of GPT-3 performing tasks with only a few prompt examples (demonstrating it learned general skills from its massive training data). This paper helps one appreciate the impact of scale in GPT models and includes technical details on training data and hyperparameters for those interested in the nuts and bolts.

- **LLaMA Research Paper (Touvron et al., 2023)** – *“LLaMA: Open and Efficient Foundation Language Models”* outlines Meta AI’s approach to building smaller-yet-powerful models. The paper details the architecture (which largely follows a GPT-like decoder transformer) and how LLaMA models range from 7B to 65B parameters. A key focus is on training efficiency: the authors show that by training on **trillions of tokens**, even a 13B parameter LLaMA can outperform much larger models. Charts in the paper compare LLaMA’s performance to GPT-3, demonstrating that LLaMA 13B matched GPT-3 175B on many benchmarks ([Language Models: From GPT to LLaMA | by Saurabh Harak | Medium](https://saurabhharak.medium.com/language-models-from-gpt-to-llama-3edcd9b856b6#:~:text=LLaMA%20is%20designed%20to%20match,makes%20LLaMA%20more%20accessible%20to)) ([Language Models: From GPT to LLaMA | by Saurabh Harak | Medium](https://saurabhharak.medium.com/language-models-from-gpt-to-llama-3edcd9b856b6#:~:text=Meta%E2%80%99s%20research%20shows%20that%20smaller,the%20best%20indicator%20of%20performance)). This is a highly technical read, but the introduction and conclusion provide a clear summary of why LLaMA is important (it made advanced LLM capabilities more accessible to the research community by open-sourcing the model).

- **Google DeepMind’s Gemini Technical Report (2023)** – A comprehensive 62-page whitepaper detailing the architecture and capabilities of **Gemini 1.0**. While much of Gemini’s architecture remains under wraps, the report confirms that it “**builds on top of Transformer decoders**,” similar to other LLMs ([Google Gemini and the future of large language models](https://www.understandingai.org/p/google-gemini-and-the-future-of-large#:~:text=published%20a%2062,not%20much%20more%20than%20that)). It also emphasizes Gemini’s native **multimodal features**, describing how text, images, and audio are represented with a unified embedding space and how the model can even generate image outputs with discrete tokens ([Google Gemini and the future of large language models](https://www.understandingai.org/p/google-gemini-and-the-future-of-large#:~:text=Multimodality%E2%80%94the%20ability%20to%20deal%20with,the%20Gemini%20white%20paper%20states)). The report includes benchmark results showing Gemini Ultra outperforming previous models on a slate of tasks. This is an advanced resource – meant for those who want to dive into the cutting-edge details – but it provides the most direct look at what makes Gemini tick and how it compares to GPT-4-class models.
