# âœ… Regression Testing Error Criteria Checklist

Regression testing ensures that new changes to the codebase have not unintentionally broken existing functionality. It plays a critical role in maintaining software stability and reliability across releases.

---

## 1. Core Functionality Verification
- [ ] Re-test critical user journeys and high-risk features (e.g., login, payment, search).
- [ ] Validate frequently used features to ensure they behave as before.
- [ ] Ensure business-critical use cases are not impacted by recent changes.
- [ ] Compare current output with baseline results from the previous stable version.
- [ ] Flag any unexpected behavioral changes or deviations from expected results.

---

## 2. Impacted Area Testing
- [ ] Test modified modules in depth to confirm the intended changes behave correctly.
- [ ] Identify and test dependent modules that rely on or interact with changed code.
- [ ] Validate any indirectly affected features to detect side effects or ripple bugs.
- [ ] Use static analysis or change impact tools to identify at-risk code paths.

---

## 3. Boundary and Edge Case Testing
- [ ] Re-run boundary tests to ensure no regression in input handling.
- [ ] Test previously reported edge cases that were fixed or stable.
- [ ] Re-execute error handling tests (e.g., invalid inputs, exception paths).
- [ ] Re-validate negative tests to ensure robustness against invalid data or actions.

---

## 4. Performance and Stability Testing
- [ ] Measure performance before and after changes to detect slowdowns or lag.
- [ ] Run stability tests under expected and high-stress conditions.
- [ ] Check for signs of memory leaks or resource exhaustion.
- [ ] Re-run load and stress tests if affected areas impact system throughput or concurrency.

---

## 5. Configuration and Environment Testing
- [ ] Re-test the system under various configuration settings (e.g., feature flags).
- [ ] Confirm compatibility across different OS versions and platforms.
- [ ] Validate the system in staging environments similar to production.
- [ ] Test changes involving database queries or schema with multiple DB backends/versions.

---

## 6. Automated Test Suite Execution
- [ ] Execute the full automated regression test suite.
- [ ] Verify that previously passing tests still pass (green-to-green check).
- [ ] Review code coverage reports to ensure adequate test coverage of recent changes.
- [ ] Identify any uncovered lines, branches, or conditions and add tests as needed.
- [ ] Integrate regression tests into the CI/CD pipeline for automatic execution on code commits or merges.

## ðŸ”„ Key Characteristics of Regression Testing
- [ ] **Repetitive**: Repeated execution of existing tests after changes.
- [ ] **Automation-Driven**: Heavily relies on automated test frameworks for efficiency.
- [ ] **Change-Focused**: Targeted at areas modified or impacted by recent code changes.
- [ ] **Stability-Oriented**: Ensures software quality and consistency over time.
- [ ] **Risk Reduction**: Helps catch unintended bugs early and protect production readiness.
