# ‚úÖ UAT (User Acceptance Testing) Error Criteria Checklist

User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is the final validation step before a system goes live. It focuses on confirming that the system meets real-world business needs and that it is ready for production from the perspective of end-users and stakeholders.

---

## 1. Business Requirement Validation
- [ ] Test the system using real-world user scenarios and tasks.
- [ ] Confirm alignment with daily business operations and workflows.
- [ ] Validate all documented acceptance criteria from user stories or requirement specs.
- [ ] Ensure the system delivers value and supports intended business outcomes.
- [ ] Test integration with upstream/downstream business processes or systems.

---

## 2. End-User Experience and Usability
- [ ] Evaluate usability and intuitive navigation from a non-technical user perspective.
- [ ] Identify and log usability blockers that could reduce efficiency or user adoption.
- [ ] Gather structured and unstructured feedback from end-users (e.g., forms, observations).
- [ ] Ensure that the system is accessible and understandable without deep training.
- [ ] Verify that help files, onboarding guides, and training materials are accurate and sufficient.

---

## 3. Data Accuracy and Integrity
- [ ] Validate that data is correctly processed and presented within real business scenarios.
- [ ] Confirm input validation, constraints, and field-level rules are enforced as expected.
- [ ] Verify that migrated data is complete, accurate, and usable.
- [ ] Cross-check reports, dashboards, and exports against expected business outputs.

## 4. System Functionality in Business Context
- [ ] Test integration with other business-critical systems (e.g., CRM, ERP, payment gateways).
- [ ] Confirm smooth data exchange and interoperation across tools/platforms.
- [ ] Evaluate response times and system availability under expected business load.
- [ ] Simulate typical user activities over time to check consistency.
- [ ] Validate error messaging from a business-user perspective ‚Äî clear, meaningful, and actionable.

---

## 5. Compliance and Regulatory Requirements
- [ ] Ensure the system meets business-specific regulatory compliance standards (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR, SOX).
- [ ] Validate that security roles, access levels, and data privacy settings align with business policies.
- [ ] Confirm that audit logs reflect required traceability for business-critical actions.
- [ ] Check that sensitive workflows (e.g., payments, approvals) are traceable and secure.

## üîÑ Key Characteristics of UAT
- [ ] **User-Driven**: Conducted by actual users, domain experts, or business stakeholders.
- [ ] **Business-Focused**: Centered on verifying business value, not technical accuracy.
- [ ] **Real-World Scenarios**: Involves end-to-end workflows in a business environment.
