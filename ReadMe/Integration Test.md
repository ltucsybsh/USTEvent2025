# âœ… Integration Testing Error Criteria Checklist

When moving from unit testing to integration testing, the focus shifts from individual components to how those components interact. 
This changes the nature of error testing significantly. Below is a comprehensive checklist for identifying and testing integration-level errors.

---

## 1. Interface Errors
- [ ] Verify correct data flow between modules (e.g., input/output values are consistent).
- [ ] Check for data corruption or truncation during inter-module communication.
- [ ] Validate data format compatibility (e.g., JSON/XML, encoding).
- [ ] Test API request formatting, payloads, and headers.
- [ ] Validate handling of all expected and unexpected HTTP status codes.
- [ ] Test API authentication and authorization across modules.
- [ ] Ensure correct communication protocols are used (HTTP, WebSockets, etc.).
- [ ] Test request/response timing and sequencing across APIs.

---

## 2. Interaction Errors
- [ ] Verify correct sequence of operations across dependent modules.
- [ ] Test for failures caused by asynchronous or delayed interactions.
- [ ] Simulate race conditions or concurrency issues.
- [ ] Confirm proper error handling when one module fails or returns invalid data.
- [ ] Validate timeout and retry behavior when interacting with unreliable modules.
- [ ] Check system behavior under varying load to detect race and sync issues.

---

## 3. Data Integrity Errors
- [ ] Ensure accurate data storage and retrieval from integrated databases.
- [ ] Test database transactions across multiple services (ACID compliance).
- [ ] Validate data consistency across services after chained operations.
- [ ] Test data transformations or mappings between formats/modules.
- [ ] Check consistent application of validation rules across modules.
- [ ] Verify no duplication or loss of data in distributed operations.

---

## 4. System State Errors
- [ ] Validate correct state transitions across subsystems (e.g., user registration to login).
- [ ] Test for invalid state transitions or skipped states.
- [ ] Ensure correct session initialization and teardown.
- [ ] Verify session data remains consistent across components (e.g., user profile updates).
- [ ] Simulate partial failures during state transitions and verify rollback or recovery.

---

## 5. Resource Errors
- [ ] Detect resource leaks (e.g., open file handles, sockets, memory).
- [ ] Confirm proper resource cleanup after integration steps.
- [ ] Test concurrent access to shared resources (e.g., simultaneous DB writes).
- [ ] Simulate low-resource environments (low memory, disk space).
- [ ] Validate behavior on network issues: timeouts, high latency, or dropped connections.
- [ ] Test for recovery or fallback when resources are unavailable.

---

## 6. Error Handling Errors
- [ ] Test error propagation across layers (e.g., service â†’ controller â†’ client).
- [ ] Ensure error messages are passed clearly and accurately.
- [ ] Validate user-friendly and developer-friendly error responses.
- [ ] Simulate failure points in external dependencies and observe cascading effects.
- [ ] Test retry strategies and ensure they donâ€™t introduce duplicate actions.
- [ ] Check that fallback or degraded modes function as expected.
- [ ] Confirm that error logging is consistent and centralized.

## ðŸ”„ Key Differences from Unit Testing
- [ ] **Interaction Focus**: Emphasize how components communicate, not just their internal logic.
- [ ] **Broader Scope**: Validate end-to-end scenarios across multiple services/modules.
- [ ] **Real-World Conditions**: Simulate production-like conditions, including network instability or third-party services.
- [ ] **Environment Dependency**: Confirm environment variables, containers, configurations, and credentials are correctly set up.
