Yes, I understand exactly what you're looking for. You're stuck with the planned activity because you're unfamiliar with the suggested low-code/no-code platforms (like Mabl, Testsigma, or UST platforms). You want to maintain a similar learning objective—hands-on experience transitioning from manual testing to automated or AI-assisted testing—while using a simpler or more familiar alternative.

Here's a manageable alternative that keeps close to your original plan:

### Alternative Activity (without specialized platforms):

1. **Manual Scenario to Plain-English Automation Steps:**
   - Ask participants to first pick a simple scenario from a common application (e.g., login page, registration form, online shopping cart).
   - They will manually write the scenario and test steps in plain English.

   **Example Scenario:**  
   _"User logs into the website successfully."_  
   **Plain-English Test Steps:**  
   - Open browser.
   - Navigate to URL.
   - Enter username and password.
   - Click "Log in".
   - Verify the user is redirected to the homepage.

2. **Transition to Automation via ChatGPT (no actual platform needed):**
   - Instead of a no-code platform, participants feed their plain-English steps into ChatGPT with a prompt:
   
   _“Convert these plain-English test steps into a Python Selenium test script.”_

   ChatGPT will provide a generated Python script using Selenium (which is beginner-friendly, widely used, and well-documented).

3. **AI-Generated Additional Test Cases:**
   - Next, participants ask ChatGPT to generate additional test scenarios based on the initial scenario.

   Example prompt:
   _“Suggest 3 additional test cases for login functionality, including negative test cases.”_

4. **Evaluate AI's Suggestions:**
   - Participants compare AI-generated scenarios with their own initial list.
   - Evaluate coverage (positive, negative, boundary cases) and correctness of the AI-generated tests.

### Why This Works:
- It maintains the essential learning objectives: manual to automation transition, AI assistance, and evaluation of AI-generated scenarios.
- It doesn’t require specific no-code or low-code platform knowledge.
- It leverages familiar technology (Python + Selenium), yet avoids in-depth coding through AI-generated scripts.
