# ✅ System Testing Error Criteria Checklist

System testing evaluates the entire system as a whole, validating both functional and non-functional requirements from an end-user and stakeholder perspective. Below is a comprehensive checklist for identifying and testing system-level errors.

---

## 1. Functional Errors
- [ ] Verify that all specified functional requirements are implemented.
- [ ] Validate system behavior against all documented use cases and scenarios.
- [ ] Confirm the system performs all business logic and rules accurately.
- [ ] Test data input, processing, and output for correctness and completeness.
- [ ] Ensure boundary and edge cases are covered in all system features.

---

## 2. Non-Functional Errors

### 🏎️ Performance Errors
- [ ] Test system response times under normal and peak load.
- [ ] Measure throughput and latency for critical transactions.
- [ ] Conduct load testing, stress testing, and endurance (soak) testing.

### 🔒 Security Errors
- [ ] Test user authentication and access control mechanisms.
- [ ] Simulate unauthorized access attempts and verify prevention.
- [ ] Test for vulnerabilities such as:
  - [ ] SQL Injection
  - [ ] Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - [ ] Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  - [ ] Directory Traversal, etc.
- [ ] Verify secure handling of user data (e.g., encryption, GDPR compliance).

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Usability Errors
- [ ] Test the system for user-friendliness and intuitive navigation.
- [ ] Validate error messages for clarity and usefulness.
- [ ] Conduct accessibility testing (e.g., WCAG 2.1 compliance).
- [ ] Include real user feedback if possible.

### ⚙️ Reliability Errors
- [ ] Test system uptime and availability over extended periods.
- [ ] Simulate component failures and verify system stability and failover behavior.
- [ ] Ensure data integrity is maintained after errors.

### 🧪 Compatibility Errors
- [ ] Test system behavior on multiple platforms, OSs, and browser versions.
- [ ] Verify correct rendering and behavior on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- [ ] Test interactions with external systems and APIs.

### 📦 Installation & Deployment Errors
- [ ] Verify that installation works on all supported platforms.
- [ ] Test upgrade paths and rollback mechanisms.
- [ ] Confirm proper uninstallation and cleanup of files/resources.

### 📚 Documentation Errors
- [ ] Check accuracy and completeness of user manuals, help guides, and technical docs.
- [ ] Validate that documentation reflects the actual system behavior.
- [ ] Ensure all instructions are easy to follow and up to date.

## 3. Error Handling and Recovery
- [ ] Verify that all error messages are clear, informative, and consistent.
- [ ] Test how the system responds to unexpected conditions (e.g., crashed services, invalid input).
- [ ] Simulate recovery from:
  - [ ] Network interruptions
  - [ ] Database outages
  - [ ] Hardware failures
- [ ] Ensure logs capture key events and errors correctly.
- [ ] Verify that audit trails are secure, traceable, and complete.

---

## 4. Boundary and Stress Errors
- [ ] Input extreme or malformed data and validate system behavior.
- [ ] Process large datasets to ensure performance and stability.
- [ ] Simulate low-memory or low-storage environments.
- [ ] Push system beyond normal limits to identify bottlenecks or crash points.

---

## 5. System Configuration Errors
- [ ] Test the system with various configuration settings (e.g., toggles, modes).
- [ ] Validate system behavior across different environment setups (dev, staging, prod).
- [ ] Verify that changes in environment variables are handled gracefully.
- [ ] Ensure config changes don't require code redeployment (if applicable).

---

## 🔄 Key Differences from Integration Testing
- [ ] **End-to-End Focus**: Tests full workflows across the system, not just module interaction.
- [ ] **Real-World Simulation**: Includes actual use case scenarios, user flows, and edge conditions.
- [ ] **Non-Functional Testing**: Covers performance, usability, compatibility, and security.
- [ ] **User Perspective**: Emulates how a real user would interact with the system.
