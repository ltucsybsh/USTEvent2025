Here’s a comprehensive list of common test types and approaches in software testing, organized into categories:

**1. Functional Testing**
- **Unit Testing:** Verifies the smallest components independently.
- **Integration Testing:** Checks combined parts or modules working together.
- **System Testing:** Validates the complete and integrated software product.
- **Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Confirms the system meets business requirements.
- **Regression Testing:** Ensures new changes haven't broken existing functionality.
- **Smoke Testing:** Quick initial checks to verify critical features after a build.
- **Sanity Testing:** Brief testing to verify recent changes in functionality.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** Validates the entire flow from start to finish.
- **Exploratory Testing:** Unstructured testing to discover defects by exploring the application.
- **User Interface (UI) Testing:** Checks the graphical user interface for consistency and functionality.
- **User Experience (UX) Testing:** Ensures ease of use and positive user interactions.
- **API Testing:** Validates APIs and web services functionality.

**2. Non-Functional Testing**
- **Performance Testing:** Evaluates responsiveness, stability, and speed under load.
    - **Load Testing:** Checks behavior under expected user load.
    - **Stress Testing:** Assesses limits under extreme load.
    - **Scalability Testing:** Tests how well software scales up or down.
    - **Spike Testing:** Evaluates response to sudden spikes in load.
- **Security Testing:** Identifies vulnerabilities to cyber threats.
    - **Penetration Testing:** Simulated attacks to test security robustness.
    - **Vulnerability Scanning:** Automated scans for known vulnerabilities.
    - **Authentication Testing:** Tests login and user management.
    - **Authorization Testing:** Verifies correct permissions.
- **Usability Testing:** Evaluates software ease-of-use from users’ perspectives.
- **Compatibility Testing:** Ensures functionality across various devices, browsers, OSs.
- **Reliability Testing:** Checks consistent behavior under prolonged use.
- **Availability Testing:** Measures uptime and stability.
- **Accessibility Testing:** Ensures usability for people with disabilities.
- **Localization/Internationalization (i18n/L10n) Testing:** Checks adaptability to different languages/cultures.
- **Compliance Testing:** Validates adherence to laws, standards, and regulations.

**3. Structural Testing (White-box Testing)**
- **Code Coverage Testing:** Measures executed code coverage during tests.
    - **Statement Coverage**
    - **Branch Coverage**
    - **Path Coverage**
- **Mutation Testing:** Alters code slightly to ensure tests catch the changes.
- **Static Analysis:** Examines source code without executing it for potential defects.
- **Dynamic Analysis:** Checks software by executing it to identify runtime issues.

**4. Change-related Testing**
- **Regression Testing:** Confirms changes haven’t negatively affected existing functionality.
- **Confirmation Testing (Retesting):** Confirms that defects have been fixed.

**5. Maintenance Testing**
- Conducted post-release to validate updates, patches, and enhancements.

**6. Installation & Deployment Testing**
- **Installation Testing:** Validates successful installation and configuration.
- **Uninstallation Testing:** Ensures proper removal without leaving residual components.
- **Upgrade Testing:** Tests smooth transition between versions.

**7. Recovery Testing**
- Assesses how software recovers after failures or crashes.

**8. Documentation Testing**
- Validates completeness and accuracy of user manuals, help files, and documentation.

**9. Risk-Based Testing**
- Prioritizes tests based on potential impact and likelihood of failure.

**10. Automated vs. Manual Testing**
- **Automated Testing:** Uses automation scripts/tools (e.g., Selenium, JUnit, pytest).
- **Manual Testing:** Human-driven testing without automation.

**11. Special-purpose Testing**
- **A/B Testing:** Compares two versions to determine user preference/performance.
- **Alpha Testing:** Conducted internally by developers before public release.
- **Beta Testing:** Conducted by external users in real-world scenarios.
- **Chaos Testing:** Deliberately introduces failures to test system resilience.
